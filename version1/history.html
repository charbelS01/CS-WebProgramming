          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The history of the World Wide Web illustrates how evolving concepts
            and regulations have transformed our methods of acquiring
            information over time. Tim Berners-Lee conceived the idea for the
            first time at CERN in 1989. The inaugural website was launched in
            1991. This was the start of hyperlinked navigation, which let
            users see content instead of reading it in a straight path.

          <h3>The first web browsers and graphical user interfaces.</h3>
          <p>
            At originally, browsers could simply show text. In 1993, "Mosaic was created at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign by computer scientist Marc Andreessen. It was the very first popular web browser and the early ancestor of Mozilla Firefox" [5]. It was a big step forward since
            it had inline images that made it easier to use and look better [5].
            In 1994 , "Andreessen founded Netscape and released Netscape Navigator to the public. It was wildly successful, and the first browser for the people" [5]. Microsoft had to make Internet
            Explorer (IE) in 1995 because Netscape became so popular so rapidly.
            Microsoft became the best firm by combining Internet Explorer with
            Windows. This caused the "browser wars" of the late 1990s.[5]

          <h3>Standards and Change</h3>
          <p>
            Websites used to be made up of only static HTML pages. They became
            more interactive with the introduction of server-side programming,
            CSS (1996), and JavaScript (1995). Flash and Java applets were
            proprietary plug-ins that made multimedia possible, but they were
            slow and not very safe. In the 2010s, HTML5 and W3C-approved APIs
            slowly took their place. You don't need any extra software to use
            rich multimedia with them [6]. The initiative to standardize has
            made it possible for all browsers to work together. The W3C and
            WHATWG were two significant groups that helped make HTML, CSS, and
            websites that are easy to use. Responsive web design became more
            popular in the early 2010s when mobile Internet became available.
            This made the purpose of standards very clearer.

          <h3>Modern Features and Competition</h3>
          <p>
            People's hopes shifted after Google Chrome came out in 2008. "It is made up of complex open source components and infrastructure, such as the Blink rendering engine" [7]. Because Chrome was so popular, other browsers including
            Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera worked to
            make some parts of it better, such speed, developer tools, and
            privacy. WebAssembly is a new technology that lets browsers run code
            that looks like it was written in the native language. This makes it
            possible for hard things like scientific simulations, video editing,
            and gaming to work perfectly online. On the other hand, modern
            browsers contain AI-powered features like real-time translation,
            predictive text, and smart tab management. Brave and Firefox are two
            browsers that put privacy first. They have become more popular since
            they need HTTPS and disable trackers.

          <h3>The Evolution of HTML Beyond 5.2</h3>
          <p>
            There were no more numbered versions after HTML 5.2 (2017). Instead, the W3C and WHATWG agreed in 2019 to keep a single HTML Living Standard that is always being updated instead of being released in different versions. There is no such thing as "HTML 6." Instead, HTML keeps getting better with each new update.[2]

          <h3>The history of CSS</h3>
          <p>
            Håkon Wium Lie came up with the idea for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in 1994 while working at CERN. The goal was to separate content (HTML) from presentation.
            On December 17, 1996, the W3C officially published the first version, CSS1, as a recommendation. It defined basic typography, colors, margins, paddings, and other things. 
            In May 1998, CSS2 came out. It added media types, positioning (relative, absolute, fixed), z-index, and support for aural style sheets and bidirectional text. 
            On June 7, 2011, a new version of CSS 2.1 was released to fix mistakes in CSS2, get rid of features that weren't well-supported, and show how widely browsers use it. 
            After CSS2.1, development switched to a modular approach, often called "CSS3," in which new features are made in separate modules instead of one big document.

          <h3>What to expect</h3>
          <p>
            These days, browsers do more than just let you get to websites.  This is shown by new technologies like voice navigation, augmented and virtual reality, and AI-powered assistants.   They are turning into places where people can have smart and fun experiences.

        <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          The differences between Chrome and Mosaic show how the Internet has changed from a place to view static documents to one where you can engage with dynamic ecosystems.    Basic access, privacy, and following the rules have never been as crucial.    If you know where this is headed, you might be able to guess what the next step in online development will be. This could include combining extended reality and artificial intelligence with browsers.
          This timeline of major browser milestones includes WorldWideWeb (1990), Mosaic (1993), Netscape (1994), Internet Explorer's rise to dominance (late 1990s), Firefox (2004), Chrome (2008), and more contemporary developments like WebAssembly.
