          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Lebanon's internet environment has a lot of users, but it also has problems with its infrastructure that won't go away.

          <h3>Lebanon: Speeds, Infrastructure, and Penetration</h3>
          <p>
            "In early 2024, internet penetration in Lebanon stood at 90.1 percent" <a href="references.html">[1]</a>.    The average upload speed for fixed broadband is 8.80 Mbps, and the average download speed is 12.49 Mbps.    Mobile internet is better since, "in March 2024, the median fixed-line broadband and mobile download speeds were 12.49 megabits per second (Mbps) and 35.58 Mbps, and upload speeds were 8.80 Mbps and 9.80 Mbps, respectively" <a href="references.html">[1]</a>.
            According to Ookla and DataReportal, the average speed of fixed broadband is about 9.39 Mbps while the average speed of mobile broadband is about 31.06 Mbps <a href="references.html">[12]</a>.    These speeds are good enough for watching videos and browsing the web every day, but they are below the world average, especially for fixed broadband.

          <h3>About the planet and its regions</h3>
          <p>
            "Mobile internet adoption continues to increase, with 57% of the world's population (4.6 billion people) now using mobile internet on their own device" <a href="references.html">[13]</a>.   Almost 96% of people can get mobile broadband networks <a href="references.html">[10]</a>.    Lebanon has a 90% internet penetration rate, which is similar to that of upper-middle-income countries, less than that of Gulf countries like the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where almost everyone has access to the internet and speeds often go over 150 Mbps.<br>
            Lebanon is performing better than some of the other less developed countries in the area, though, where cost and infrastructure are still big problems.    Lebanon's internet speeds are slower than those of Egypt or Jordan, yet more people are using it.

          <h3>Problems in Lebanon</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Economic Crisis: Because the economy is still unstable, people are less likely to put money into communication infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Lack of electricity: Networks don't work as well when the power goes out.</li>
                <li>Old infrastructure: Copper lines are the most common type of fixed broadband, and fiber is only available in cities.</li>
                <li>Cost and Affordability: The prices of gadgets and services are still high compared to what most people make.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The impact it has on the economy and society</h3>
          <p>
            Lebanon has a lively digital culture even if it has problems because so many people use the internet.    A lot of people use social media, and a lot of younger people are switching to mobile-first.    However, slower fixed-line internet complicates the initiation of high-tech businesses, pursuing higher education, and working remotely.<br>
            Small and medium-sized businesses face significant challenges in their digital transformation when internet reliability is lacking.     Conversely, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations are rapidly implementing fiber-to-home and 5G initiatives.    As a result, Lebanon might struggle to maintain competitiveness in the digital landscape.

          <h3> Ways to improve</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expanding fiber networks: Fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) could significantly enhance fixed broadband speeds.</li>
                <li>Leveraging Mobile Growth: Lebanon's mobile performance can remain robust with increased investment in 4G and 5G networks.</li>
                <li>Encouraging Digital Skills: Increasing the number of programs that educate individuals on technology usage will aid in bridging the gap and enhance accessibility for all.</li>
                <li>Collaborating in the region: If funding is insufficient in the area, partnering with global telecom companies could provide a solution.</li>
            </ul>
