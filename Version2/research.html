            Håkon Wium Lie came up with the idea for Cascading Style Sheets
            (CSS) in 1994 while working at CERN. The goal was to separate
            content (HTML) from presentation. On December 17, 1996, the W3C
            officially published the first version, CSS1, as a recommendation.
            It defined basic typography, colors, margins, paddings, and other
            things. In May 1998, CSS2 came out. It added media types,
            positioning (relative, absolute, fixed), z-index, and support for
            aural style sheets and bidirectional text. On June 7, 2011, a new
            version of CSS 2.1 was released to fix mistakes in CSS2, get rid of
            features that weren't well-supported, and show how widely browsers
            use it. After CSS2.1, development switched to a modular approach,
            often called "CSS3," in which new features are made in separate
            modules instead of one big document.<a href="references.html"

          <p>
            In Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), @-rules are specific directives
            that instruct the browser on how to process or include style
            information. The @ symbol precedes a keyword such as "media,"
            "import," or "font-face." @-rules do not associate selectors with
            style declarations as conventional CSS rules do. Rather, they
            regulate the manner, timing, and location of style application.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>Examples of @-rules include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              @import is a method for incorporating external CSS files into a
              stylesheet.
            </li>
            <li>
              @media enables the establishment of rules that are applicable
              exclusively to specific screen dimensions or device
              characteristics.
            </li>
            <li>
              @supports enables the verification of feature support prior to the
              application of styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              @font-face is a method for specifying and importing custom fonts.
            </li>
            <li>@keyframes enables the creation of animations.</li>
            <li>
              @page rule is utilized to configure print layout parameters.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Contemporary CSS specifications permit the utilization of nested
            @-rules, enhancing design modularity, responsiveness, and logical
            organization. These regulations render CSS adaptable and simple to
            modify, which is crucial for developing instructional websites that
            function effectively across all devices and browsers.<a

            JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape
            Communications Corporation. It was originally named Mocha, later
            changed to LiveScript, and finally renamed JavaScript as part of a
            marketing collaboration with Sun Microsystems, which developed the
            Java programming language. The goal was to create a lightweight
            scripting language for web browsers that could make web pages
            interactive.<br />
            The first version of JavaScript appeared in Netscape Navigator 2.0,
            and within a year Microsoft released a similar implementation called
            JScript for Internet Explorer. This led to inconsistencies between
            browsers, making standardization necessary.<br />
            In 1996, JavaScript was submitted to ECMA International for
            standardization. The standardized version, named ECMAScript, was
            published in June 1997 as ECMA-262. Over the following decades,
            ECMAScript editions introduced major enhancements such as classes,
            modules, arrow functions, and asynchronous programming features.<br />
            Today, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the modern web,
            alongside HTML and CSS. It powers client-side interactivity,
            server-side development (through Node.js), and even mobile and
            desktop applications—making it one of the most influential
            programming languages in computing history.<a href="references.html"

      <section class="collapsible">
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          id="Difference between i++ and ++i"
          class="collapsible-input"
        />
        <label for="Difference between i++ and ++i" class="collapsible-label">
          <h3>Difference between i++ and ++i</h3>
        </label>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
          <p>
            In JavaScript, both i++ and ++i are used to increase a variable’s
            value by one, but they work slightly differently. The expression i++
            is known as the post-increment operator, meaning the current value
            of i is used first, and then it is incremented. In contrast, ++i is
            the pre-increment operator, which increases the value of i before it
            is used. For example, if i is 5, then let a = i++; assigns 5 to a
            and then changes i to 6, while let b = ++i; first increments i to 6
            and then assigns 6 to b. When used in simple statements like i++; or
            ++i;, both produce the same final result because the expression’s
            return value is ignored. However, when used inside expressions or
            assignments, the difference becomes important depending on whether
            you need the old or the new value. In most for loops, such as for
            (let i = 0; i < 5; i++), both forms behave the same since the result
            of the increment expression is not used directly—only the side
            effect (increment) matters. In summary, i++ returns the old value
            before incrementing, while ++i increments first and returns the new
            value.
