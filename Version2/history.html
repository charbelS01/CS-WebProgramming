          <h2>From Tim Berners-Lee to WebAssembly</h2>
        </header>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The history of the World Wide Web illustrates how evolving concepts
            and regulations have transformed our methods of acquiring
            information over time. Tim Berners-Lee conceived the idea for the
            first time at CERN in 1989. The inaugural website was launched in
            1991. This was the start of hyperlinked navigation, which let users
            see content instead of reading it in a straight path.

          <h3>The first web browsers and graphical user interfaces.</h3>
          <p>
            At originally, browsers could simply show text. In 1993, "Mosaic was
            created at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
            (NCSA) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign by computer
            scientist Marc Andreessen. It was the very first popular web browser
            and the early ancestor of Mozilla Firefox"
            <a href="references.html">[5]</a>. It was a big step forward since
            it had inline images that made it easier to use and look better.<a
              href="references.html"
              >[5]</a
            >
            In 1994 , "Andreessen founded Netscape and released Netscape
            Navigator to the public. It was wildly successful, and the first
            browser for the people" <a href="references.html">[5]</a>. Microsoft
            had to make Internet Explorer (IE) in 1995 because Netscape became
            so popular so rapidly. Microsoft became the best firm by combining
            Internet Explorer with Windows. This caused the "browser wars" of
            the late 1990s.<a href="references.html">[5]</a>

          <h3>Standards and Change</h3>
          <p>
            Websites used to be made up of only static HTML pages. They became
            more interactive with the introduction of server-side programming,
            CSS (1996), and JavaScript (1995). Flash and Java applets were
            proprietary plug-ins that made multimedia possible, but they were
            slow and not very safe. In the 2010s, HTML5 and W3C-approved APIs
            slowly took their place. You don't need any extra software to use
            rich multimedia with them <a href="references.html">[6]</a>. The
            initiative to standardize has made it possible for all browsers to
            work together. The W3C and WHATWG were two significant groups that
            helped make HTML, CSS, and websites that are easy to use. Responsive
            web design became more popular in the early 2010s when mobile
            Internet became available. This made the purpose of standards very
            clearer.

          <h3>Modern Features and Competition</h3>
          <p>
            People's hopes shifted after Google Chrome came out in 2008. "It is
            made up of complex open source components and infrastructure, such
            as the Blink rendering engine" <a href="references.html">[7]</a>.
            Because Chrome was so popular, other browsers including Mozilla
            Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera worked to make some
            parts of it better, such speed, developer tools, and privacy.
            WebAssembly is a new technology that lets browsers run code that
            looks like it was written in the native language. This makes it
            possible for hard things like scientific simulations, video editing,
            and gaming to work perfectly online. On the other hand, modern
            browsers contain AI-powered features like real-time translation,
            predictive text, and smart tab management. Brave and Firefox are two
            browsers that put privacy first. They have become more popular since
            they need HTTPS and disable trackers.

          <h3>The Evolution of HTML Beyond 5.2</h3>
          <p>
            There were no more numbered versions after HTML 5.2 (2017). Instead,
            the W3C and WHATWG agreed in 2019 to keep a single HTML Living
            Standard that is always being updated instead of being released in
            different versions. There is no such thing as "HTML 6." Instead,
            HTML keeps getting better with each new update.<a

          <h3>What to expect</h3>
          <p>
            These days, browsers do more than just let you get to websites. This
            is shown by new technologies like voice navigation, augmented and
            virtual reality, and AI-powered assistants. They are turning into
            places where people can have smart and fun experiences.

          <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            The differences between Chrome and Mosaic show how the Internet has
            changed from a place to view static documents to one where you can
            engage with dynamic ecosystems. Basic access, privacy, and following
            the rules have never been as crucial. If you know where this is
            headed, you might be able to guess what the next step in online
            development will be. This could include combining extended reality
            and artificial intelligence with browsers. This timeline of major
            browser milestones includes WorldWideWeb (1990), Mosaic (1993),
            Netscape (1994), Internet Explorer's rise to dominance (late 1990s),
            Firefox (2004), Chrome (2008), and more contemporary developments
            like WebAssembly.
